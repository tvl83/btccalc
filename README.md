#BitCalc
==============

Quick Reference BitCoin Calculator.

Enter a value in any of the text boxes and it will calculate all of the other values at the different denominations.

It pulls the price from [Coinbase](coinbase.com) to get the USD value. More denominations can be added if it is wanted.

Note: These are a little large because of the overhead required for it to be a node-webkit application. It uses chromium in the background which is not a lite program.
That is why my tiny little calculator is 20mb+ on windows :(

**OR**

Clone this repository if you already have [Node Webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit) and just drag this folder to the nw.exe and it will run.

##Ideas for Future Updates

* Choose your denomination
* Choose a different exchange to retrieve the value
