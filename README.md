BTC Calculator
==============

Quick Reference BitCoin Calculator.

Enter a value in any of the text boxes and it will calculate all of the other values at the different denominations.

It pulls the price from coinbase.com to get the USD value. More denominations can be added if it is wanted.

BIG CHANGE
================

**I am now creating this app as a node-webkit app so that it is cross platform and standalone.**
